# What is the shell?

The shell (sometimes referred to as the “Unix shell”, for the operating system where it was first developed) is a program that allows you to interact with your computer using typed text commands. It is the primary interface used on Linux and Unix-based systems, such as macOS, and can be optionally installed on other operating systems such as older versions of Windows. As of Windows 10 the Unix shell comes pre-installed but must be turned on.

## Why should I use it?

Most of the time when we work with files on a computer the graphical user interface (GUI) that we are familiar with does the job. This is how we visually navigate, scroll, and click through information on our computers.

It's when we are dealing with a large number of files or files that are scattered across many different locations that the shell is very useful. Any time that you need to do something very repetitive to a large number of files, for example renaming everything in a folder or separating out all of a certain type of file, there is likely a way to use the shell to speed up your work.

## How do I get to it?

For Mac and Linux, which are Unix based systems, you can access the Unix shell through an application called "Terminal". It is findable like any other piece of software installed on your computer.

For Windows 10 users the Unix shell needs to be turned on but is available as a part of the operating system. Previous versions of Windows required you to install it separately.
