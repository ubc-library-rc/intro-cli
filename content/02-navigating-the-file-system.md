# Navigating the file system

Let's start by opening the unix shell. There are a few things you are likely to see right away. A cursor that is flashing next to a $ indicates where the command line begins. If you see the dollar sign it means that the command line is ready to take commands.

~~~
$
~~~

You are communicating with your computer by giving it commands and having it react to those commands.

## Orienting yourself
Let's enter our first command "pwd" which stands for "print working directory" and will tell us where we are in the system. The term "directory" refers to what you might visually think of as a "folder" when browsing your file system.

Input
{: .label .label-green}
~~~
$ pwd
~~~
Output
{: .label .label-yellow}
~~~
/Users/egrguric
~~~


Input
{: .label .label-green}
~~~
$ ls
~~~
Output
{: .label .label-yellow}

## Getting help
Commands come with instructions that you can access from the command line by invoking the "manual". You can also access this manual documentation online.

LS(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    LS(1)

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-
     ciated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

:
~~~
Notice the colon : which indicates that there is more text and you can keep paging through it by hitting "enter". To quit the manual hit the "q" key which stands for "quit".

You can only go to places that exist.

## Moving around

Input
{: .label .label-green}
~~~
$ cd Desktop

The case of the directory doesn't matter on Mac or PC but does on Linux.

Switch back and forth between two directories. Note that you don't need to enter "pwd" to get a filepath with cd -.

Input
{: .label .label-green}
~~~
$ cd -
~~~
Output
{: .label .label-yellow}
~~~
/Users/egrguric
