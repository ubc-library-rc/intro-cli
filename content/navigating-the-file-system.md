# Navigating the file system

Let's start by opening the unix shell. There are a few things you are likely to see right away. A cursor that is flashing next to a $ indicates where the command line begins. If you see the dollar sign it means that the command line is ready to take commands. 
```console
$
```
You are communicating with your computer by giving it commands and having it react to those commands. 

Let's enter our first command "pwd" which stands for "print working directory" and will tell us where we are in the system. The term "directory" refers to what you might visually think of as a "folder" when browsing your file system. 
```console
pwd
```
